If an element has a position of **relative, absolute or fixed,** it's known as **positioned**.\n\n\n### Website Example\n---\nhttp://everylastdrop.co.uk/\n\n","idx":3},"relative-positioning":{"content":"# Relative Positioning\n---\n\n### What it does\n---\nAdding relative positioning to an element does two things:\n\n1) Makes an element a \"positioned\" element \n\n2) Allows that element to be moved by using the CSS commands **top, bottom, left, and right**\n\n### Adding Relative positioning\n---\n\n```css\n.my-element {\n    position: relative; \n}\n```\n\n### Code examples\n---\n[Example 1](http://samantha.fewd.us/#app/ZackDinerstein/Relative_Example_1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n","idx":4},"z-index":{"content":"\n# Z-Index\n---\n\n### What it does\n---\nLets you determine which element takes precedence when two or more elements are stacked on top of each other. \n\n### How it works\n---\nElements with lower indexes will appear to be underneath those with higher indexes.  \n\n\n### Adding a z-index\n---\n\n```css\n.element-one {\n    z-index: 1; /* Appears below .element-one */  \n}\n\n.element-two {\n    z-index: 150; /* Appears above .element-one */  \n}\n```\n\n### Code examples\n---\n\n[Example 1](http://samantha.fewd.us/#app/ZackDinerstein/z-index_example)","idx":5},"absolute-positioning":{"content":"# Absolute Positioning\n---\n\n### What it does\n---\nAdding absolute positioning to an element does four things:\n\n###### same as relative\n1) Makes that element a \"positioned\" element\n\n2) Allows you to move that element using the CSS rules top, right, bottom, left. \n\n###### different than relative\n3) Knocks that element out of the normal document flow (similar to what floating does to elements) \n\n4) Positions that element relative to its nearest positioned parent element.\n\n### Adding absolute positioning\n---\n\n```css\n.my-element {\n    position: absolute; \n}\n```\n\n\n### What this all means\n---\nAn absolutely positioned element will look at its parent elements and will try to find an element that's positioned (is relative, absolute, or fixed).\n\nIf it finds a parent that is positioned, it'll move itself to the top left corner of that element. Now, if you ad top, right, bottom, or left styling to that element, it will move itself in relation to that parent div.\n\nConfusing right? It's probably easier to just play around with some code.\n\n\n### Code examples\n---\n[Example 1](http://samantha.fewd.us/#app/ZackDinerstein/Absolute_Example_1)\n","idx":6},"fixed-positioning":{"content":"# Fixed Positioning\n---\n\n### What it does\n---\nAdding Fixed positioning to an element does two things:\n\n###### same as relative\n1) Allows you to move that element using the CSS rules top, right, bottom, left. \n\n###### same as absolute\n2) Knocks the element out of the normal document flow\n\n###### different than both\n3) \"Fixes\" that element to a location on your site.\n\n### Adding absolute positioning\n---\n\n```css\n.my-element {\n    position: fixed; \n}\n```\n\n\n### What this means\n---\nBy making an element 'fixed,' that element will remain glued to a location on a user's screen and essentially ignore all scrolling that's done by the user.\n\nFor example, navbars that stay glued to the top of your screen regardless of how far down you scroll on a particular website... those navbars are 'fixed' elements.\n\n\n\n### Code examples\n---\n[Example 1](http://samantha.fewd.us/#app/ZackDinerstein/Fixed_Example_1)\n","idx":7},"links":{"content":"# Links\n---\nhttp://learnlayout.com/position.html","idx":8},"exercises":{"content":"","idx":9},"__list__":["home","title","desc","a-new-page","relative-positioning","z-index","absolute-positioning","fixed-positioning","links","exercises"]}
